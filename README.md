# README for Workflow Automation Application

## Overview
This application is designed to automate various workflows that facilitate data processing and integration across multiple systems. It handles data synchronization, event-driven processing, and report generation by integrating with file systems, REST APIs, and databases. The primary goal is to streamline operations by automating repetitive tasks, ensuring data consistency, and improving overall efficiency in business processes.

## Integration Details
The application integrates with:
- File systems for data input and output.
- REST APIs for data retrieval and submission.
- Databases for storing and managing structured data.
Data flows in and out in various formats, including JSON and CSV, depending on the specific workflow requirements.

## Installation Steps
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed as specified in the project documentation.
- Configure the necessary environment variables and authentication credentials for the integrated systems.
- Run the application using the provided command to initiate the workflows.

## Variables Used
- **activityGroup**: Defines the group of activities for organizing workflows.
- **activityName**: Specifies the name of the individual activity being executed.
- **activityType**: Indicates the type of activity (e.g., data processing, API call).
- **authType**: Specifies the authentication method used for API access.
- **accountName**: The name of the account used for authentication.
- **accountKey**: The key associated with the account for secure access.
- **sasToken**: A token used for secure access to resources.
- **hasHeader**: Indicates whether the data includes a header row.
- **skipFirstDataRow**: Specifies if the first data row should be skipped during processing.
- **strictHeaders**: Enforces strict header matching for data processing.
- **quoteChar**: Defines the character used for quoting strings in data.
- **columnSeparator**: Specifies the character used to separate columns in data.
- **arrayElementSeparator**: Defines the character used to separate elements in an array.
- **lineSeparator**: Specifies the character used to separate lines in data.
- **nullValue**: Defines the representation of null values in the data.
- **columns**: Lists the columns to be processed in the data.

## API Details
- **API Name**: Data Processing API
  - **Endpoint**: `/api/data/process`
  - **Description**: This API is used to process incoming data, applying transformations and validations as defined in the workflows.

- **API Name**: Authentication API
  - **Endpoint**: `/api/authenticate`
  - **Description**: This API handles user authentication and returns tokens for secure access to other APIs.

## Processes / Workflows
- **Workflow 1**: Data Ingestion
  - This workflow ingests data from specified sources, preparing it for processing.

- **Workflow 2**: Data Transformation
  - This workflow applies transformations to the ingested data, ensuring it meets the required format and standards.

- **Workflow 3**: Data Export
  - This workflow exports the processed data to designated destinations, such as databases or file systems.

## Error Handling
The application employs robust error handling mechanisms to ensure reliability:
- **Retry Logic**: In the Data Ingestion workflow, if an error occurs during data retrieval, the system retries the operation a specified number of times before failing.
- **Conditional Logic**: The Data Transformation workflow includes conditional checks to validate data integrity before proceeding.
- **Exception Handling**: Alerts are triggered in the Data Export workflow if the export fails, notifying the relevant stakeholders.
- **Notifications**: The application sends notifications to external systems or users in case of critical failures, ensuring timely responses to issues.
